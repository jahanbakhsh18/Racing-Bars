# Racing-Bars
This simple project is a showcase for the Racing-Bars React demo in the dashboard of an admin panel.
For the backend, I used the default Serenity demo, which is a straightforward TypeScript/.NET Core framework with useful demos.
You can customize its Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to use it in Dockerized environments as well.

If you encounter an exception while running PostgreSQL migrations like I did:
1- Enable identity insert for tables:
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Region" ALTER COLUMN "RegionID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Employees" ALTER COLUMN "EmployeeID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Categories" ALTER COLUMN "CategoryID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Shippers" ALTER COLUMN "ShipperID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Suppliers" ALTER COLUMN "SupplierID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Products" ALTER COLUMN "ProductID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."EmployeeTerritories" ALTER COLUMN "ID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE "public"."Orders" ALTER COLUMN "OrderID" SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT;
2- Change the UnitPrice column in OrderDetails from money to numeric.
